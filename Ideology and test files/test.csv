Peak winds were estimated at 75 mph.  Damage was almost entirely from downed trees.  In that regard numerous homes and a few parked vehicles were damaged by trees falling onto them.  ||First damage was noted near the Bretton Woods golf course along River Road.  Damage continued along Bonnie Dale Drive and Glenhurst Ct where several trees were downed in the community.  Also, near the intersection of Turkey Foot Road and Jones Lane in southwest Montgomery County near North Potomac MD a few large trees were over the road.  The tornado raced east at nearly 60 mph to the northern section of Rockville MD.  At least 14 homes were significantly damaged by uprooted trees.  As it continued east to the Norbeck and Aspen Hill area 30 trees were uprooted in the Manor County Golf Club as well as numerous homes damaged in the surrounding communiteis from tree damage.  Tree damage was noted along the intercounty connector route 200 at the Layhill Road exit.  Finally a few trees were downed in Spencerville and Burtonsville.||Additionally there was a parallel 7 miles path of damage through South Rockville and Glenmont MD with similar tree damage.

In the same area, vertical wind shear was ideal for the development of supercells. Along the dryline, discrete supercell thunderstorms developed shortly after the noon hour. These supercells produced 60+ mph gusts and hail up to the size of hen eggs.  As the afternoon progresses discrete supercells progressed to the east and merged into a squall line.
