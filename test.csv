This was an unusual synoptic set-up, with low pressure lingering off the coast of southern New England for several days. Snowfall was difficult to forecast due to concerns about precipitation type and boundary layer temperature. In the end, precipitation type turned out to be all snow for much of the area, with most locations receiving 1 to 2 feet of snow.  In addition, the Massachusetts east coast was hit by widespread moderate and pockets of major coastal flooding for two high tide cycles and beach erosion for at least 5 high tide cycles.",Five to sixteen inches of snow fell across eastern Hillsborough County.
