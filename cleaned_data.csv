In that regard numerous homes and a few parked vehicles were damaged by trees falling onto them.  ||First damage was noted near the Bretton Woods golf course along River Road.  Damage continued along Bonnie Dale Drive and Glenhurst Ct where several trees were downed in the community.  Also, near the intersection of Turkey Foot Road and Jones Lane in southwest Montgomery County near North Potomac MD a few large trees were over the road.  The tornado raced east at nearly 60 mph to the northern section of Rockville MD.  At least 14 homes were significantly damaged by uprooted trees.
